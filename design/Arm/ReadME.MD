The present design of robotic arm is inspired from the open source robotic arms. The design files uploaded here can only used for the simulations purposes. The design of the arm can be modified for producing the prototypes. 
Presently the files uploaded here are the STL formatted files. These files can be imported to any CAD software without any difficulties. Further quiries on design can be contacted to the shraavistakashyap@gmail.com.
While working in MATLAB-simulink, convert these files into step ap214 files as these formatted files are helpful.
